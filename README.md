# pwnable.tw "Start" Challenge Solution
In this repository I've included a python script that solves the "start" challenge (https://pwnable.tw/challenge/#1).
It connects to the remote challenge and injects shellcode that opens a shell and prints the flag.

## Prerequisites
For it to work you need python3, nc, nasm & ld locally, prob in a linux environment (didn't test on Windows).
